# 🚀 Space Missions Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive data analysis and visualization dashboard built with **Power BI**, based on a comprehensive space missions dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to clean and transform raw data to uncover key insights and trends in the history of space exploration, from the early days of space travel to modern-day missions.

The final dashboard provides a clear, compelling story about mission success rates, financial costs, and the major players in the space industry.

## ✨ Key Highlights
* **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and transformed a raw dataset to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and extract valuable information using Power BI's Query Editor.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Designed and built an intuitive, interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to filter and explore data by country, company, and mission status.
* **Key Insights:** Discovered and visualized critical trends, including the companies with the highest success rates, and how launch success has evolved over time.
* **Visualization Skills:** Utilized a variety of charts and graphs in Power BI to present complex data in an easy-to-understand format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Power BI:** For data cleaning, modeling, and interactive dashboard creation.
* **Kaggle:** Source of the original space missions dataset.
* **Excel / Power Query:** Used for initial data preparation and cleaning steps.
